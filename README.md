## Contribution Guide

_So... you want to start making changes?_

_Maybe a new feature or a bugfix?_

> Well, here are the steps to get started:

1. First, [create an issue](https://github.com/npranto/logtrade/issues/new) on Github before making any changes to the code. Make sure to add `Label`, `Assignee` and `Project` to the issue

- Clone the repository + install dependencies (refer to [Development Setup](#development-setup) above
- Checkout `develop` branch
- Create a new branch - `logtrade-[ISSUE_NUMBER]`, i.e., `logtrade-87`. The issue number will automatically be generated by Github when you create one
- Make code changes, commit, and push up the feature branch up to remote
- Create a pull request to merge changes to `develop` branch
- Get at least 1 code review approval
- Once approved, merge the changes to `develop` branch and close out the issue
